# How to Be a Meta Editor

The main thing meta editors can do that normal users can't is view the list of rounds/answers and assign answers to puzzles. (It's up to your team to decide who should be meta editors. On the website, ask a [superuser](admin.md) to assign the "Can change round" permission to a user to make them an editor. Also, the site doesn't actually require a user who has the role of "editor" on a specific puzzle to have the "meta editor" role as described below.)

## Rounds and Answers

As a meta editor, you can create and edit rounds and answers from the "Rounds/Answers" page, linked from the top bar. (This link will only be visible if you are a meta editor.)

Puzzlord also tracks who is spoiled on each round, and on this page, will only show you answers from rounds you're spoiled on. (If a puzzle has an answer assigned, though, anybody spoiled on the puzzle can see that answer and the round it's assigned to from that puzzle page.)

On the other hand, each round can have a description and each answer can have notes, both of which are only visible to editors spoiled on the round.

## Assigning Answers

To assign an answer to a puzzle, go to the puzzle and click "edit" next to "Answers:" near the top of the page. You'll be brought to a page with all answers you're spoiled on and can select which answer or answers you want to assign to or unassign from the puzzle.

By default, only answers that have not been assigned to other puzzles will be visible; uncheck the "Hide answers assigned to other puzzles" checkbox at the top to show all answers. Puzzlord will also warn you if you try to assign multiple answers to one puzzle. However, it absolutely allows you to have unusual many-to-many relationships between puzzles and answers if you really want to.

There is no way to assign an answer that's not part of a round, but you should feel free to create a "Dummy round", put answers in it, and assign those answers to puzzles in case you ever need the testsolving answer checker to accept partial/intermediate answers or instructions.
